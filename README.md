# kodi-playercorefactory
Sample playercorefactory.xml file for using VLC as an external player for Kodi on Ubuntu.

playercorefactory.xml should be located at ~/.kodi/userdata when installed with APT.
Other package managers such as flatpak and snap sandbox their apps in such a way that opening secondary apps such as VLC is blocked. 
It's possible there's a workaround for this, but I was unable to find one.
As such, I'd recommend using an APT installation.
